# LangChain Examples

LangChain example are broken out into two groups:

1. AWS 
2. OpenAI

Depending on which examples you are working with, you will need the coresponding backend 
platforms configured. 


## OpenAI

In order to execute the OpenAI examples, configure:

1. A project e.g. "LangChainExamples" under the projects section of your OpenAI account at: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/projects

2. An API Key associated with the project. This can be created at: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys

Remember to then set the API Key in your environment, for example on the Mac:

`export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"`
